# Introduction #

site.ini


# Details #


  * The site's information is going to be kept up-to-date in a file named site.ini, here we' ll store the usr, passw and inet address.

  * This avoids putting REAL data in an example. :-)

the file site.ini must have 3 lines.
  1. site name, e.g. "ftp.example.com", "ftp.kernel.org"
  1. user, e.g. imurdock, rms, esr
  1. password , e.g. iamgod, godami, godisme

this makes config easier.
